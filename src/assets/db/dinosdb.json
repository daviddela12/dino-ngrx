      "description": "Aardonyx is known from 2 immature individuals. Adults would have been much larger, probably over 10m.\n\nAardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on 2 legs) but also capable of walking on all 4 legs. This and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later.",
