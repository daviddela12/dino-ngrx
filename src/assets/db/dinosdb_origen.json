Adults would have been much larger, probably over 10m.\n\nAardonyx would have been largely bipedal (walking on 2 legs) but also capable of walking on all 4 legs. This and its way of feeding are transitional features between those of basal sauropodomorphs and the more derived sauropods (large dinosaurs that walked on all fours) that came later."

    "description": "Ceratosaurus means 'horned lizard'. The dinosaur was given this name because it had a row of sharp horns on its head and a row of small, bony pieces of armour running along its back. It is not known what this body armour was for, but it could have been for protection from attack by other Ceratosaurus or larger theropods such as Allosaurus and Torvosaurus.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tScientists have estimated that Ceratosaurus was about six to seven metres long. It seems to have been quite a rare animal - remains of it are much rarer than those of the Allosaurus that lived alongside it.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCeratosaurus was one of the biggest hunters in the Jurassic Period. Its prey probably included plant-eating dinosaurs, but some scientists have suggested that it may have fed upon aquatic animals such as fish, turtles and crocodiles.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCeratosaurus is remarkable for the very long, slender teeth in its upper jaw. These teeth could be over nine centimetres long, nearly as long as the lower jaw was deep, so they would almost stick out beyond it when the mouth was closed. Nobody really knows why the teeth were so long, but they may have helped it inflict deep, slashing wounds in prey."

The sharp teeth and grasping claws of Coelophysis would have helped them to hold and kill their food.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCannibalism?\n\t\t\t\tA fossil find of an adult skeleton with what appeared to be young Coelophysis bones inside its rib cage led scientists to speculate that Coelophysis ate each other when the opportunity arose.\n\nRecent analysis has disproved this, however, by showing that the bones inside the ribcage are not a baby Coelophysis after all, but belong to a small crocodile.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHollow bones\n\t\t\t\tCoelophysis means 'hollow form' and this comes from the hollow limb bones.

There has been some debate over how such a long neck would have been held.\n \nScientists now think that ligaments running from the hip to the back of the neck would have allowed Diplodocus to hold its neck in a horizontal position without using muscles. The vertebrae (back bones) are split down the middle and this space could have held ligaments like these.\n \nDiplodocus may have had narrow, pointed bony spines lining its back.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA Museum icon\n\t\t\t\tIn 1905 a cast of a Diplodocus skeleton was donated to the Museum by the wealthy businessman Andrew Carnegie, based on the original specimen in the Carnegie Museum in the USA.\n\nKing Edward VII had requested a copy of the newly discovered dinosaur after seeing a picture of it in Carnegie's Scottish castle. From 1979 to early 2017 the cast - known affectionately as Dippy - was on display in the Museum's Hintze Hall.\n\nIn 1993, Dippy's tail was lifted from the ground after research revealed that Diplodocus tails would have been raised high to balance the neck.\n \nEvery two years or so, Museum experts used specialist equipment to clean the 292 bones that make up Dippy. It takes two staff two days to clean the cast and make sure it is maintained for future generations to enjoy.\n\nDippy has now left the Museum to go on a natural history adventure. From February 2018 to October 2021 Dippy will be visiting eight venues across the UK."

After finding a specimen that had been covered with mud, which had held the plates in place, Marsh realised that they stood vertically, alternately on either side of the spine.\n\nScientists are not exactly sure what the plates were used for. They may have warned off predators, or allowed members of the same species to recognise each other. Another suggestion is that the plates were used to regulate body temperature.\n\nThere are tiny grooves in the plate surfaces, possibly where blood vessels would have been. The amount of blood passing through these vessels would determine the amount of heat transfer.\n\nCompared with the rest of its body, Stegosaurus had a small head and its brain was around the size of a plum!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tA new star specimen\n\t\t\t\tThe most complete Stegosaurus skeleton ever found went on display in the Museum’s Earth Hall in December 2014.\n\nIdentified as a member of the species Stegosaurus stenops, this spectacular specimen is helping researchers gain new insights into what Stegosaurus would have looked like when it was alive, as well as how it walked, ate and behaved."

A partial Triceratops fossil collected in 1997 has a horn that was bitten off, with bite marks that match Tyrannosaurus. The fossil shows that the horn healed after being bitten, so at least some Triceratops survived these encounters.\n\nPuncture marks on fossil frills show that male Triceratops also used their horns to fight each other, probably to impress females.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHerd instinct\n\t\t\t\tMany other horned dinosaurs are known to have lived in herds because of a fossil find of many different individuals at the same location.\n\nBy moving in herds, prey animals can warn each other of danger and lessen their chances of being singled out by a predator.\n\nHowever, Triceratops was unusual in this respect, as their remains are usually found individually, suggesting they may have spent much of their lives alone.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhy the frill?\n\t\t\t\tThe Triceratops frill might have helped to protect its neck, but some specimens show Tyrannosaurus bite marks puncturing the frill, so it wasn't always enough.\n\nThe frills could also have been used to attract mates, as a way for members of the same species to recognise each other."

Analysis of fossilised Tyrannosaurus dung show that it contained the bones of its prey. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHunter or scavenger?\n\t\t\t\tThe Tyrannosaurus skull was over 1.5m (5 feet) long and the cavity that housed the part of the brain responsible for smell was relatively large.\n\nTyrannosaurus would have used its good sense of smell to hunt live prey and locate dead bodies to scavenge. It would have been able to scare off any other scavengers, so it didn't have to share.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLone or pack hunter?\n\t\t\t\tSome Tyrannosaurus fossils show bite marks from other tyrannosaurs, so it's clear that they fought each other, whether over food or mates.\n\nWe know that close relatives of Tyrannosaurus sometimes lived together because there are fossils of groups who were buried together, but we don't know for sure if they hunted alone, or in packs like lions and wolves do today. So far, no groups of Tyrannosaurus skeletons have been found."
